    Worked on a distributed filesystem/LVM and tools that wrap around it to
    provide a robust storage solution for customers.
  highlights:
    - Solved several high-availability issues in the network layer of the
      filesystem/LVM that needed urgent attention due to customer workflows
      being interrupted.
    - Designed and implemented an XML parser using Perl. After this, an external
      parser was no longer needed (thus getting rid of possible security issues)
      and writing parser extensions for other teams is easier.

      and easier customer interaction with the product.
